# Todo
- [x] Consolidate duplicate `handle_version_creation` implementations and keep the corrected logic.
- [x] Implement a robust `handle_note_creation` that syncs notes between PBV and UNDARK, avoiding duplicates.
- [ ] Smoke test the sync handler (at least via code review/log reasoning) and note manual test steps.
